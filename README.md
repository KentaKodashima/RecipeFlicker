# RecipeFlicker

## Overview
RecipeFlicker allows you to make your own favorite recipe lists. Even if you can't come up with anything you want to cook for the night, RecipeFlicker offers random recipes from all around the world.

## Concepts
- Keep good recipes
- Share good recipes with friends

## Target
- People who cook
- People who are in need of help to decide what to cook

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1

Implement the core functions and publish the app without any trouble.
#### Functionalities
- Swipe to decide recipe(Tinder-like UI)
- Next random recipes are available at 7 am everyday
- Open up WebKitView to see the detail of the recipe
- List right-swiped recipes as the user's favorites
- Use Firebase as database for the later use
- Use Realm to store Firebase anonymous user id and everyday's random recipes

### Phase 2
#### Objective
Implement full functionality.
#### Functionalities
- Firebase authentication (email / password, Facebook, Google)
- Register preferable and unpreferable ingredients
- Random recommendation of someone's collection shows up after the user swipes all recipes of the day
- Post URL with comment
- Follow / Unfollow people
- Save someone's recipe to the user's favorite

## Database Architecture
### Firebase
```
root
  ├ users
  |  └ userId
  |     └ userId
  | 
  ├ favorites
  |  └ userId
  |     └ recipeId
  |        ├ firebaseId
  |        ├ image
  |        ├ isFavorite
  |        ├ originalRecipeUrl
  |        ├ realmId
  |        └ title
  | 
  ├ userCollections
  |  └ userId
  |     └ collectionId
  |        ├ collectionId
  |        ├ name
  |        └ image
  |            
  └ recipeCollections
     └ collectionId
        └ recipeId (= firebaseId)
           ├ firebaseId
           ├ image
           ├ isFavorite
           ├ originalRecipeUrl
           ├ realmId
           └ title
